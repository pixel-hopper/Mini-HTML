## 🚀 Instructions

1. Keep both the Python script and optional `.bat` launcher in any folder.  
2. Run the script by double-clicking the `.bat` file or executing the `.py` file directly.  
3. Click **“Select HTML File”** to browse and choose the `.html` or `.htm` file you want to minify.  
4. Choose a location to save the minified version.  
5. The cleaned HTML will be saved with the prefix **`minified_`** in the filename.

   - `os`, `re`

## 🌟 Features

1. Simple one-click GUI to minify HTML
